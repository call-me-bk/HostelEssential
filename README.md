Welcome Devs!
Keep these few guidelines in mind as you develop the app:
-> Don't forget to follow coding conventions during naming classes, variables and indenting the code.
-> Do comment out the piece of code which you either feel is important or is unreadable for others.
-> Refrain from using unnecessary variables if not required.
